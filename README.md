# Wlcome to BreezePomodoro ‚è≤Ô∏è

## Introdcution

Welcome to my Customizable Pomodoro Timer project! This is a practical mini-project I developed to hone my web development skills and create a tool that I can use in my daily life. This timer is designed to help you stay productive by managing your work and break intervals effectively. With a focus on flexibility and customization, this tool can be tailored to suit your personal preferences and workflow.

**difficulty : 3/10**

## Features

### Pomodoro Timer ‚è≥
- This timer follows the Pomodoro Technique, a popular time management method that alternates between focused work sessions and short breaks. It's an excellent way to enhance productivity and maintain focus over longer periods.

### Customizable Intervals ‚åö
- You can adjust the number of intervals to match your work habits. Whether you prefer shorter or longer work sessions, the timer adapts to your needs.

### Adjustable Focus Duration üíª
- The focus duration is fully customizable, allowing you to set the exact amount of time you want to work on a task. Whether it's 25 minutes or 2 hours, you have full control.

### Flexible Rest Duration üí§
- Rest periods are just as important as work sessions. You can customize the length of your breaks to ensure you recharge effectively between work intervals.

### Sound Effects üîä
- Enhance your focus and relaxation with carefully selected sound effects:

    - **Light Tick Sounds:** Subtle ticking sounds play during work sessions, providing a gentle auditory cue to help maintain your focus. (well tried and well advised)
    - **Session Separation Sounds:** Beautiful and cozy sounds mark the end of each session, signaling it's time to take a break or start a new work interval. These sounds are designed to be pleasant and non-intrusive, ensuring a smooth transition between work and rest periods, with a slightly unique sound to reward finishing the full session!

### Wallpaper Customization üèûÔ∏è
- Personalize your timer with different background options. You can choose from a variety of preset wallpapers or upload your own image. The timer also includes a custom blur feature, allowing you to adjust the background's sharpness to your liking.

### Theme Selection üé°
- Switch between three unique themes: **Lagoon**, **Owl**, and **Monkai**. Each theme offers a distinct visual style, ensuring that the timer not only functions well but also looks great.

### Persistent Settings with Local Storage üóÉÔ∏è
- All your custom settings are saved in your browser's local storage. This means that your preferences are retained even after closing the browser, providing a seamless and consistent experience.

### Responsive Design üì±
- The timer is designed to be flexible and responsive, ensuring it works beautifully on a variety of screen sizes‚Äîfrom desktops to tablets and smartphones. This makes it easy to use whether you're at your desk or on the go.

## Technologies Used üë©‚Äçüíª

- **HTML**: The foundation of the website's structure.
- **CSS**: Used to style the interface and create visually appealing layouts.
- **SASS**: Employed for more organized and maintainable CSS, with features like variables and mixins.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the interactivity and functionality of the timer, handling everything from timing logic to theme switching.

*Started with Node.js but It was a bit of of an overkill*

This project is organized with separation of concerns in mind. HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript files are neatly structured in their respective directories, making it easier to maintain and expand. A compressed version of the files is also available, optimized for hosting and deployment.
